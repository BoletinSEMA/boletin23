<span 
class="ecrm-0900">studies and forums that have been carried out at the international level demonstrating that</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">Modelling, Simulation and Optimization are tools for research and innovation, and are keys for</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">achieving a competitive edge and a catalyst for innovation processes in companies. This</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">contribution of mathematics is far from having reached its peak and it is expected that</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">the new paradigms related to the 4th industrial revolution will continue to bring new and</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">challenging opportunities. In this presentation we will emphasize the unique strength of</span>

class="ecti-0900">Why a crowd is a “social, hence complex,” system and how mathematical sciences can contribute</span>

</p><!--l. 1740--><p align="justify" class="indent" >   <span

class="ecrm-0900">The answers to the key questions take advantage of recent research</span>

class="ecrm-0900">In this talk I will discuss the role of mathematics in the society from diﬀerent perspectives. The</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">situation is clearly very diﬀerent in diﬀerent countries and continents. It is interesting to follow these</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">diﬀerences, analyze them and learn from each other. But also, depending on the fields and</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">subfields, mathematics and mathematicians have to play, and play, diﬀerent roles, that can be</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">conflicting. How to reach a balance between educating the new generations, preparing the future</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">teachers, providing companies and institutions with educated people able to innovate using</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">mathematics? In some countries and in some fields this is not so easy to implement any</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">more. Our community at large will have to deal with these difficulties and try to reach a</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">balance. This will not happen alone, we should accompany the quick and sometimes dramatic</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">evolutions if we want to maintain a healthy situation country by country, but also at a global</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">level.</span>

   <span 
class="ecrm-0900">Macroscopic traffic flow models have become popular in transportation engineering and applied</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">mathematics during the last decades. These models give a description of collective dynamics in terms of</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">spatial density and average velocity, which evolve according to partial diﬀerential equations derived</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">from fluid dynamics, coupled with suitable closure relations. In fact, even if the continuum hypothesis is</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">clearly not physically satisfied, macroscopic quantities can be regarded as measures of traffic conditions</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">and allow depicting the spatiotemporal evolution of traffic waves. Moreover, they are suitable for</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">analytical investigations and very efficient from the numerical point of view. Therefore, they provide</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">the right framework to state and solve control and optimization problems for real time</span>
                                                                          

                                                                          
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">applications Starting from the celebrated Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model formulated in</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">the mid 50s, mathematicians and engineers designed various more sophisticated models in</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">order to capture specific traffic characteristics. These include second order, phase-transition</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">and non-local models. Extensions to road networks have also been addressed by providing</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">suitable models describing the dynamics at junctions. These improved models are expected to</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">better match observations based on real data coming form diﬀerent sources: besides the</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">traditional magnetic loop detectors, the recent technological developments provide data</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">extracted from video recording, GPS, Bluetooth, RFID, etc. In my talk, I will briefly review the</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">basis of the macroscopic approach for modeling vehicular traffic, and I will show how these</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">models can be efficiently implemented for traffic flow optimization. In particular, I will</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">focus on traffic control strategies based on ramp-metering, variable speed limits and partial</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">rerouting. Further control perspectives are oﬀered by the future deployment of autonomous</span>

   <span 
class="ecrm-0900">We begin by a short discussion of various definitions of applied mathematics. Then two</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">mathematical models of natural phenomena will be presented. The first one is a system of interacting</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">particles which occupy lattice sites. We look for configurations of particles which minimize the</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">interaction energy, the so-called ground-state configurations. We ask whether non-periodic ground-state</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">configurations can be stable against small perturbations of interactions and thermal motions. Such</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">stable structures can be then viewed as microscopic models of quasi-crystals. Gene expression and</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">regulation can be modeled by deterministic kinetic ordinary diﬀerential equations or by stochastic</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">Markov jump processes. It is natural to assume that biochemical processes involve time</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">delays. We show that time delays do not necessarily lead to oscillations as it is usually</span>

class="ecrm-0900">Operations Research (OR) is an established and widely used discipline aimed at employing</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">mathematical methods and computer science to support decisions of planners in several application</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">areas ranging from industry to transportation, energy production and distribution and resource</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">scheduling. During the last decades a rich set of eﬀective methodologies were developed within</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">Operations Research for the solution of hard combinatorial optimization problems which generally rely</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">on their structured mathematical optimization formulations. In the recent years, Data Science(DS), and</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">in particular Machine Learning and Data Mining, emerged as a powerful set of techniques capable of</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">extracting relevant information from large amounts of data for which no analytical distributions and</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">mathematical formulations are known: this is generally performed by using statistical formulations</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">solved through mathematical optimization techniques. The strong connections between OR and</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">DS can foster important advances in the possibility of eﬀectively support decision making</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">both by improving the eﬀectiveness DS algorithms and in allowing a broader and more</span>
