class="ecrm-0900">In order to date Mars surface and sub-surface sediments, IN-TIME aims to build a</span>
<span

<span 
class="ecrm-0900">addition, a miniaturized version of the instrument will be developed as an application to be used on</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">Earth in disciplines such as archaeology, geology or risk assessment for emergency events where</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">dosimetry is required. Luminescence dating relies on defects in the crystal lattice of dosimeter minerals,</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">in order to trap energy produced during the interaction between electrons within the crystal. Therefore,</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">an accurate characterization of the background radiation from radionuclide radioactive decay</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">and galactic cosmic rays is really crucial to properly use this technique. Consequently, the</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">deﬁnition of the Mars radiation environment needs to be addressed in the initial part of the</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">project. Some previous studies have dealt with this topic using measurements from earlier</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">missions. On the other hand, a few Martian radiation models have been developed, focusing on</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">the fact that measuring the radiation on the surface of Mars is essential prior to human</span>

<span 
class="ecrm-0900">need to be addressed. For simplicity, we divide them into two groups: external and internal sources.</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">Among the external sources we have, naturally, the solar radiation, the galactic cosmic rays (GCR),</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">and the solar energetic particles (SEP). The solar Mars radiation environment at the planet surface has</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">been already modeled </span><span class="cite"><span 
class="ecrm-0900">[</span><span 
class="ecbx-0900">?</span><span 
class="ecrm-0900">]</span></span><span 
class="ecrm-0900">. Nonetheless, it needs to be complemented taking into account the</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">contributions of the GCR and SEP. Moreover, it is required to calculate the attenuation curve of</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">these contributions from surface down to 3 meters below Mars surface, as this is the drilling</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">capabilities limit planned for the near future missions to Mars by both the American National</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the European Space Agency (ESA).</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">On the other hand, regarding the internal sources, it is necessary to take into account the</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">composition of Mars surface and subsurface. Again, for this application we will be interested</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">down to 3 meters depth. Of course, it will be essential to properly parameterize the average</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">contribution to the radiation environment (and attenuation) from each of the soil mineral</span>

class="ecrm-0900">Regarding GCR and SEP, it is important to notice that Mars does not have a global</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">magnetic ﬁeld like the Earth. It is thought that Mars actually had once in the past a global</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">magnetic ﬁeld, but billions of years ago its driving mechanism shut down for unknown reasons.</span>
<span 
class="ecrm-0900">Nowadays, there are only leftovers of this older magnetism: magnetised minerals which</span>
<span
